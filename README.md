# edc-tictactoe

We have a very smelly implementation of TicTacToe (Game.cs, GameShould.cs files).

Start by identifying the smells and then **slowly** refactor the code.

Remember to keep the tests passing at all times during the refactor.

It's ok to revert back to a previous working state at any moment.
